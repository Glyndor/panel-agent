# panel-agent

`lynx-agent` — hardened server-side daemon for the [Lynx panel](https://github.com/Glyndor/panel).

It runs on each managed VPS and executes commands sent by the dashboard:
containers (rootless Podman), firewall (nftables), tunnels (WireGuard) and
system maintenance.

## Security model

- **Transport** — WireGuard + mTLS. The agent never accepts plain connections.
- **Command integrity** — every command is Ed25519-signed with a nonce and a
  30-second timestamp window; replays are rejected even on a compromised
  transport.
- **Audit log** — hash-chained, append-only, synced to the dashboard in real
  time.
- **Auto-update** — binaries are Ed25519-signature-verified before any swap.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

Depends on [`lynx-compose`](https://github.com/Glyndor/podman-compose) as a git
dependency.

## Install

The agent is installed and updated by the panel installer — see
[Glyndor/panel](https://github.com/Glyndor/panel). `setup-agent.sh` and
`update-agent.sh` in this repository are invoked by that flow.
